# GNU Useless Manipulation Program
A very bad art program, but still better than [DuckDood's readST](https://github.com/DuckDood/readST).<br>
GUMP is a... "minimalist" art program that has very few features.
# How to Install
Download one of the releases - the .zip is for Windows, .AppImage for Linux.<br>
The compiled stable builds of GUMP can also be found [here](https://milorad-co.github.io/GUMP.htm). They can also be installed in the following ways:<br>
