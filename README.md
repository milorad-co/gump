# GNU Useless Manipulation Program
A very bad art program, but still better than [DuckDood's readST](https://github.com/DuckDood/readST).<br>
GUMP is a... "minimalist" art program that has very few features.
# How to Install
Download one of the releases - the .zip is for Windows, .AppImage for Debian-based Linux.<br>
If you are on Windows, you should unzip the .zip, then run GUMP.exe. If you are on Linux, you can run the .AppImage without any setup.
