# GNU Useless Manipulation Program
A very bad art program, but still better than [DuckDood's readST](https://github.com/DuckDood/readST).<br>
GUMP is a... "minimalist" art program that has very few features.
# How to Install
First, install [the Milorad Application Installer](https://github.com/milorad-co/milorad-installer).<br>

Windows: Run the command `milorad install gump` **while Git Bash is administrator** on Windows.
# Known Issues
